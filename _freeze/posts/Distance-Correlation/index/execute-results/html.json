A remarkable statistic, simply remarkable, has fallen into my lap. Forget about the correlation coefficient, that accursed, nearly useless, but always used statistic. Useless, I say? Well, perhaps I am exaggerating for theatrics. Nonetheless, we all know the famous example at which it fails utterly. Let $X$ be a random variable talking both negative and positive values, and let $Y$ be another random variable such that \n\n$$Y = X^2$$\n\nAnd we can plot them together:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nx <- runif(1000, -10, 10)\ny <- x**2\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe two variables are certainly dependent, but there is no *linear* relationship, and so if we compute the correlation coefficient it will turn out to be $0$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncor(x, y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -0.01151053\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow here comes the new measure, introduced in [Measuring and testing dependence by correlation of distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4101v1), and called the distance correlation $R$. $R$ satisfies two conditions:\n\n1. $R(X, Y)$ is defined for $X$ and $Y$ of arbitrary dimension, i.e, $dim(X)$ doesn't necessarily have to equal $dim(Y)$.\n\n2. $R(X, Y) = 0$ iff $X$ and $Y$ are independent.\n\nAre these two conditions not beautiful? \n\nI am not going to talk about the definition and the inner machinery, but the measure is implemented in the R package \"Energy\" written by authors of the paper. Let's compute $R$ instead of the correlation coefficient in our previous example.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(energy)\n\ndcor(x, y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.5032529\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich is certainly far enough from $0$ to imply a strong degree of dependence.",
