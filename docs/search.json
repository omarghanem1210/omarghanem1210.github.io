    "title": "A Non-Rigorous Derivation Of The Stirling Approximation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Stirling approximation is a way to approximate \\(x!\\) by the seemingly incomprehensible formula:\n\\[x! \\approx e^{- x} x^{x + \\frac{1}{2}} \\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\]\nThere is, of course, a completely rigorous way of defining and proving this, rife with integrals, but such a way gives no intuition about why such a formula is true. A far better way of proving it goes like this: let \\(X\\) be a binomial random variable which represents the number of successes in \\(n\\) trials with probability \\(p\\) of success. Then we can write \\(X\\) as a sum of \\(n\\) Bernoulli random variables\n\\[X = B_1 + B_2 + ... + B_n\\]\nsuch that each \\(B_i\\) is a bernoulli random variable with probability \\(p\\) of success. By the central limit theorem we have that as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), the distribution of \\(X\\) will approach \\(\\mathcal{N}(np,\\, npq)\\), where \\(q = 1 - p\\).\nNow here comes the trick, as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), let \\(p \\to 0\\) while keeping \\(np = \\lambda\\), which is a constant. And we all know what the distribution will now tend to right? A poisson distribution with rate \\(\\lambda\\). Also, as we have that \\(n \\to \\infty\\) and \\(p \\to 0\\), the mean of \\(X\\) will approach \\(\\lambda\\) and its variance will also approach \\(\\lambda\\) (If you are wonder why that is the case, take the limit of \\(npq\\) under the given conditions and see what happens).\nWe now know two things: the first is that as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) and \\(p \\to 0\\), \\(p(X) \\approx \\mathcal{N}(\\lambda, \\lambda)\\) and also that \\(p(X) \\approx poisson(\\lambda)\\). Therefore, logically, we have that \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\lambda, \\lambda) \\approx poisson(\\lambda)\\), and so\n\\[\\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^x}{x!} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\lambda}} e^{\\frac{-1}{2}(\\frac{x - \\lambda}{ \\lambda})^2}\\] We can now substitute \\(x\\) with \\(\\lambda\\) and we will have\n\\[\\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^\\lambda}{\\lambda!} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\lambda}}\\] And the formula that we want follows easily enough\n\\[\\lambda! \\approx e^{- \\lambda} \\lambda^{\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}} \\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\]\nThe question now is how large the relative error is? Does it perhaps increases as \\(\\lambda\\) increases? Intuitively, we would guess no, nowhere in our derivation have we assumed anything about the magnitude of \\(\\lambda\\), and the approximation between the normal and poisson distribution holds irrespective of what number \\(\\lambda\\) actually is. But just to feel good, let’s check a few values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\nx!\napproximation\nrelative error\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n0.922137\n0.0778630\n\n\n2\n2\n1.919004\n0.0404978\n\n\n3\n6\n5.836210\n0.0272984\n\n\n4\n24\n23.506175\n0.0205760\n\n\n5\n120\n118.019168\n0.0165069\n\n\n9\n362880\n359536.872842\n0.0092128\n\n\n10\n3628800\n3598695.618741\n0.0082960\n\n\n12\n479001600\n475687486.472776\n0.0069188\n\n\n17\n355687428096000\n353948328666100.812500\n0.0048894\n\n\n20\n2432902008176640000\n2422786846761135616.000000\n0.0041577\n\n\n33\n8683317618811885938468668682226228200\n8661418381417952528044480808868426880.000000\n0.0025220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we see that the relative error in fact decreases as \\(x\\) increases."

    "title": "Midnight Ramblings: A Short Story",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every now and again I find myself in the mood to write a short story, which I then write, and which I then try to get published, but which never gets published.\nHere is one:\n\nMidnight Ramblings\nWe were at our usual meeting place, my friend and I, the small and desolate coffee shop located three blocks away from the unlicensed chemist, at the end of the blind alley where the clown was killed most gruesomely the week before. We had been talking about the murder, but the talk had petered out soon after starting, seeing as neither of us possessed particularly strong feelings concerning the clown. In the silence, my friend watched his coffee cup which lay untouched in front of him, and I watched the shop’s owner, Sally, as she kept unceasingly dusting the clean and sparkling pinewood floor of the shop. Sally herself, almost surely, was watching us in our little corner booth, but with her ears instead of her eyes.\n“My wife killed Tabby,” my friend suddenly said, breaking the silence.\nI laughed loudly. It seemed the funniest thing in the world to me, my friend’s wife killing Tabby. But perhaps it wasn’t so funny, I wouldn’t know. It was approaching midnight, and in this horrible last hour of the day, with my mental and physical state being by all metrics below standard, it was the toss of a coin whether I would deem something tragic or comical.\nMy friend stared disappointedly at me as I laughed but didn’t interrupt. He was very polite, was my friend. His parents had raised him extremely well.\n“Sorry, sorry, something was stuck down my throat,” I said. I paused for a few seconds, then I couldn’t contain myself. “How did she kill Tabby, and would you by any chance have a picture?”\n“No, I don’t have a picture. Of course I don’t have a picture. Can you imagine my state of mind at the time?”\n“Yes, yes,” said I, and muttered some platitudes. I then remembered to give my condolences, though it was perhaps a little late.\n“Thank you for your thoughts,” he said. “But I want your advice, and Sally’s as well.”\nInstantly, making no attempt to hide her eavesdropping, Sally stopped cleaning, left the broom near the counter, and started approaching us. And why not approach us? There were no customers other than my friend and I in the shop; there were never any customers other than my friend and I in the shop. I just hoped to God she wouldn’t sit next to me.\nShe stopped near the table, let her eyes roam wildly all over the place. Then her lips pulled apart, showing yellow, dirty teeth, in an absolutely horrendous attempt at smiling.\n“I heard my name,” she said. She took a seat next to me, so that I was besieged on both sides, with the wall to my right, where a cockroach had been crawling like a snail for the past hour, trying to reach the open window, and Sally to my left. I started wriggling to the right, in order to put a vast distance between us. There wafted from her a disgusting, stomach-churning smell, as per usual.\nAs I silently, and hopefully stealthily, made my way towards the cockroach, my friend explained the matter succinctly to Sally.\n“Disgusting, absolutely disgusting,” she said. You were disgusting, I wanted to say, but held my tongue.\n“I agree. You should have seen how proud she was afterwards, laughing and joking and saying all manner of derogatory things concerning Tabby”\nI stopped wiggling, seeing perhaps a chance to satiate my curiosity. “How about you describe the murder? More data is always helpful in these matters.”\n“Ignore him. I know how hard this must be for you,” Sally told my friend, and patted my shoulder affectionately, to show she meant nothing offensive, as if we… As if we were lovers. Did she want us to be lovers? Was there a chance that I could love her back? I decided that no, I couldn’t possibly reciprocate her affections, not after where her hands had been inside the week before. I was nearly cheek to cheek with the cockroach by now, its antennas waving hither and thither, its small legs moving in a flurry, to no avail; a lot of force, but no work at all. I wondered if it was perhaps diseased.\n“What am I to do with her?” my friend asked.\n“Kill her,” Sally said. “Creep behind her while she is in the kitchen, grab a knife, and then…” She pantomimed stabbing a person from behind.\n“No class, no class at all,” I muttered.\nSally hissed, wounded at my justified criticism. “Then do you have a better idea?” she asked.\n“There is an abandoned park,” I said. “Near the baker’s store–that blind baker who sells the worm-filled cookies. Inside the park, there usually sleeps a rabid dog. But nobody knows he is rabid, due to his unusual resistance to wakefulness.” I paused at this point of the proceedings, sensing a strange affinity with the dog. An unusual resistance to wakefulness. It seemed a shame to bring trouble to such an enlightened creature.\n“Yes, what should I do with the dog?” my friend asked.\n“A little thought and it’s obvious.” I felt something hairy and rough caress my right cheek.\nMy friend hummed, and I imagined the deep thoughts swirling inside his head. Sally started tabbing her fingers on the table while gazing at me suggestively. I thought about the clown, that demented, depressed clown, who couldn’t make me laugh no matter what he said or did.\nSoon after, my friend and I left. He–I presume– went to his house and wife, and I to my little apartment. I passed by the park where the dog slept, beneath the light of the full moon. Poor thing, I thought, the only true victim should things proceed. I would admonish my friend severely, I decided, once he takes my advice."

    "text": "I may have fallen in love. A remarkable statistic, simply remarkable, has fallen into my lap. Forget about the correlation coefficient, that accursed, nearly useless, but always used statistic. Useless, I say? Well, perhaps I am exaggerating for theatrics. Nonetheless, we all know the famous example at which it fails utterly. Let \\(X\\) be a random variable talking both negative and positive values, and let \\(Y\\) be another random variable such that\n\\[Y = X^2\\]\nAnd we can plot them together:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nx &lt;- runif(1000, -10, 10)\ny &lt;- x**2\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two variables are certainly dependent, but there is no linear relationship, and so if we compute the correlation coefficient it will turn out to be \\(0\\).\n\ncor(x, y)\n\n[1] -0.01151053\n\n\nNow here comes the new measure, introduced in Measuring and testing dependence by correlation of distances, and called the distance correlation \\(R\\). \\(R\\) satisfies two conditions:\n\n\\(R(X, Y)\\) is defined for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) of arbitrary dimension, i.e, \\(dim(X)\\) doesn’t necessarily have to equal \\(dim(Y)\\).\n\\(R(X, Y) = 0\\) iff \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\nAre these two conditions not beautiful?\nI am not going to talk about the definition and the inner machinery, but the measure is implemented in the R package “Energy” written by authors of the paper. Let’s compute \\(R\\) instead of the correlation coefficient in our previous example.\n\nlibrary(energy)\n\ndcor(x, y)\n\n[1] 0.5032529\n\n\nWhich is certainly far enough from \\(0\\) to imply a strong degree of dependence."

    "text": "The Characters\nWe all know how characters in this genre are like. They are always… how do I say it? Too clean perhaps? Yes, too clean. I don’t mean cleanliness as in moral cleanliness– I speak about the fantasy genre as a whole, even the grimdark sub-genre of it. Rather, I mean spiritual cleanliness. There are no dark spots in their spirits, no ambiguity. Even when ambiguity exists, it often feels artificial, contrived, and so in your face that it stops being ambiguous and just becomes another trait in the character’s personality– an affectation.\nConsider the following list of archetypes:\n\nThe Dark Lord.\nThe Evil Sorcerer.\nThe Hero.\nThe Barbarian.\nThe Rogue with the heart of gold.\n\nThe first archetype, the Dark Lord, I have never seen written well, except perhaps in Malazan Book of the Fallen, though the word is never explicitly used (there are certainly dark lords in Malazan, if we consider dark lords to be beings of considerable strength considered unanimously by the world to be a great threat). Of the Evil Sorcerer and The Barbarian, I cannot fail to consider Joe Abercombie, who wrote these two archetypes with a great deal of complexity. But it’s not complexity that I wish to find but ambiguity. I think most of us when considering the Evil Sorcerer of Abercomie’s (I will not name names, In case you haven’t read the books) would, without hesitation, say what he would or wouldn’t do. The same goes for the Barbarian.\nOf the Hero I needn’t speak. Of the Rogue, we have Locke Lamora, the gentleman bastard, but again, I don’t think there is any doubt about what he would or wouldn’t do in a given situation.\nK.J Parker’s characters aren’t like that. You never quite know what what they are going to do. Sometimes they are hypercompetent, and at other times they seem incapable of doing anything right. They are both frightening and frightened. In Parker’s world every human being is capable of doing anything under the right circumstances; there are no limits or red lines. And they are never archetypes.\nThe protagonists of a Parker book are rarely, if ever, inherently evil. What they seek is usually quite mundane: love, money, peace of mind, or merely not to die, but what they receive is rarely what they seek. They commit atrocities for the sake of their goals, or merely in a moment of anger, and they often feel bad about what they did afterwards. But they get right back to work soon after, for they share two qualities that is much in abundance inside all of us:\n\nThe potential to commit any kind of act\nThe ability to rationalize and justify their every action.\n\nWhen meeting a Parker protagonist, I say, watch your back, and make sure that you don’t blink."

Family is nearly always an essential part of the plot. And how could they not be, these people to whom we are bound by an unbreakable string not of our own making? Siblings, parents, children and lovers abound, with all the drama that such abundance entails.\nBut the drama is cold, sick. Worms and maggots fester. Read the books if you would like, but don’t come blaming me once things take an unanticipated turn."

Perhaps I was used to fantasy authors succumbing to the irresistible urge to lay their world bare. By succumbing to that urge, they make their world feel small, minuscule, for no amount of maps and detailed geographical description can make one writer’s imagination equal to that of the world. In contrast, Parker is far more subtle; scattering a smattering of hints throughout all his works, he induces in the reader a feeling of grandness unrivaled in any other fictional world, except perhaps that of Erikson’s.\nThere is magic and supernatural creatures in this world, but they are rarely mentioned in his main novels. If you would like to read K.J Parker with a more supernatural bent, read his collections of short stories. They are filled to the prim with witches, gods, sorcerer and devils."

    "title": "The Republic Of Plato: Book 1",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI started reading The Republic knowing nothing about it except two things: That it’s concerned with the nature of justice, and that in it Plato lays out his vision of an ideal society. I decided to write a series of blog posts about it, one for each book, for a total of, if I can manage it, ten posts. That was to force myself to actually think about what I am reading, as well as to have some fun. As I am writing this now, I have only finished book 1. Wish me luck! And please, let me know if I misunderstood or forgot to mention anything in the comments. It wouldn’t be very Socratic of me not to wish for discussion.\nBefore this, I had read a few of Plato’s dialogues and I think The Republic is the only one other than The Apology where Socrates is actually narrating in first person. I wonder if that’s of some importance.\nNow, before I start, let’s think first about justice, which is the main concept discussed in book 1. If we think intuitively, what is justice anyway? For me, and I think for most of us, the first thing that comes to mind is this:\n\n\n\nThomas Rowlandson (1756–1827) and Augustus Charles Pugin (1762–1832), The Old Bailey\n\n\nA court of law. Lawyers, judges and all that. The condemnation of the maleficent and the exoneration of the innocent. But is that really what justice is? Perhaps you and I can agree that the exoneration of the innocent is just; it would be a very unjust thing to punish somebody for a crime they didn’t commit after all, but is punishing the criminal a just action? On that, a lot of us may disagree. I am not here considering the point that the laws may be wrong, that the criminal may not actually be evil; rather let the criminal of which I speak have committed a most heinous crime, the question remains: Is punishing him just? Is that what justice is, good for good and evil for evil? Giving to each what they deserve?\nWell, let’s not be hasty. We have a long book to get into, after all.\n\n\nThe background of the dialogue\nThe book starts with Socrates attending a festival, alongside his friend, Glaucon, at the port of Athens when they are accosted by a group of seemingly rough types.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese rough types threaten and intimidate Socrates and Glaucon into staying at the festival instead of returning to Athens. At the head of these men is a gentleman called Polemarchus. They all then go to Polemarchus’s house, and the dialogue starts.\n\n\nFirst definition of justice\nInside the house Socrates meets Polemarchus’s father, Cephalus, who is a rich man. Cephalus inherited most of his money from his own father, and lists the many benefits of wealth. But first and foremost of all benefits, he says, is that wealth allows one to be just. With it, one has no reason to cheat his fellow men; with it, one has less reason to lie and is able to pay back any debts that he owes and can offer sufficient sacrifices to the gods.\nSocrates, naturally enough, once he had the slightest hint that Cephalus believed himself to know what justice is, asks him about it. But Cephalus is busy, with his sacrifices and the festival, and so his son, Polemarchus tells Socrates what justice is.\nTo Polemarchus, justice is:\nThe giving back of what’s owed.\nBut there are cases, as Socrates notes, where giving back what’s owed may be unjust. Such as when you owe your friend a gun, say, and he demands it back, but you notice that he isn’t in his right mind and something truly tragic would occur if you return it. Would it then be just to give it back?\nPolemarchus agrees with this, and says that by “what’s owed” he means only what’s good to friends, and what’s bad to enemies. Socrates then makes a very strange argument which I don’t quite understand. He says to Polemarchus that then by “what’s owed” he means “what’s fitting”, and that he is saying that justice is giving to one’s friends and enemies what’s most fitting to them. All well and good. Then things take a turn for the strange.\nHe asks Polemarchus what is it that’s owed and fitting that the art(by art, I assume he means occupation, or craft, or suchlike) called medicine gives and to whom or what. I had better quote the whole bit of dialogue, just to prevent my own confusion.\n\n“In the name of Zeus,” I said, “if someone were to ask him, ‘Simonides, the art called medicine gives what that is owed and fitting to which things?’ what do you suppose he would answer us?”\n“It’s plain,” he said, “drugs, foods and drinks to bodies.”\n“The art called cooking gives what that is owed and fitting to which things?”\n“Seasonings to meats.”\n“All right. Now then, the art that gives what to which things would be called justice?”\n“If the answer has to be consistent with what preceded, Socrates,” he said, “the one that gives benefits and harms to friends and enemies.”\n“Does he mean that justice is doing good to friends and harm to enemies?”\n“In my opinion.”\n\nWhy does Socrates suddenly assume that justice is an art? That seems inexplicable to me. They continue in that direction for a while, Socrates and Polemarchus, and describe what each art is useful for. They conclude that Justice, in so much as it’s an art by assumption, is most useful when somebody is needed to guard some money. Quite the anticlimax if I may say so. In any case, Socrates does some more proof by analogy:\n\n“Let’s look at it this way. Isn’t the man who is cleverest at landing a blow in boxing, or any other kind of fight, also the one cleverest at guarding against it?”\n“Certainly.”\n“And whoever is clever at guarding against disease is also cleverest at getting away with producing it?” “In my opinion, at any rate.”\n“And, of course, a good guardian of an army is the very same man who can also steal the enemy’s plans and his other dispositions?”\n“Certainly.”\n“So of whatever a man is a clever guardian, he is also a clever thief?”\n“It seems so.”\n“So that if a man is clever at guarding money, he is also clever at stealing it?”\n“So the argument indicates at least,” he said.\n“The just man, then, as it seems, has come to light as a kind of robber, and I’m afraid you learned this from Homer. For he admires Autolycus, Odysseus’ grandfather on his mother’s side, and says he surpassed all men ‘in stealing and in swearing oaths.’ Justice, then, seems, according to you and Homer and Simonides, to be a certain art of stealing, for the benefit, to be sure, of friends and the harm of enemies. Isn’t that what you meant?”\n\nThis is all convincing enough, but the argument seems somewhat wasteful, since its main assumption, that justice is an art, is so farfetched. Wait, could it be that the argument whole point was to show that justice isn’t an art? Perhaps Socrates isn’t lying when he says that he truly wishes to know what justice is, and so he is trying to know justice by what it is not. Yes, I think that’s how it is. He isn’t simply engaging with Polemarchus, but is also trying to find out the truth for himself.\nSo his argument was as follows:\n\nAssume justice is an art like medicine, or cooking, or dancing, or whatever; that it’s something to be learned and practiced\nArt, in general, is the “giving of what’s owed or fitting to something”\nJust as the artist is master of “giving of what’s owed or fitting to something”, he is also master at not doing that, or at giving what is not fitting. Want to demolish a building? Call a constructor(I may have just invented an aphorism)\nBut then a just man will turn out to be the best thief there ever was, which contradicts what we intuitively know about justice, so our assumption was wrong after all. Justice isn’t an art.\n\nI still think the strange notion of “art” that the Greeks have is doing a lot of heavy lifting. No matter, let’s continue.\nSocrates then forgets about justice as art, and attacks the definition from another direction. Now, instead of justice being art, it’s virtue. I don’t think this time is the same as before, where the main aim was to show what justice is not. I think Socrates is taking justice to be– or at least a part of– virtue because that’s something he, or rather we, all of humanity, believes. So he is really going to attack the definition here.\nHe tries to prove that the part about doing harm to enemies is wrong, but the argument is rather general; it won’t matter if we think of the definition as what we conjectured at the start, that it’s just to meet evil with evil. Socrates then proves that doing harm to a person causes a loss of virtue in that person using a proof by analogy– I am starting to hate proof by analogies. He says that causing harm to dogs or horses cause a loss of virtue to dogs or horses(does he assume that the virtue of dogs and horse lies in being obedient to human beings?) and so the same thing happens in humans.\nBut then evil for evil cannot be justice, he says, because a thing can’t produce its opposite. Heat can’t produce cold. Water can’t make something dry. So it is that justice, which is a virtue, cannot cause a loss of virtue as a byproduct.\nI believe the main weakness of this argument to be the part about dogs and horses. I may have to consult a dog or a horse trainer. Would the trainer know what I am talking about if I ask what’s the virtue of an animal?\nIn the end, Socrates and Polemarchus become friends, and promise to wage battle on anybody who says justice is doing good to friends and harm to enemies.\n\n“We shall do battle then as partners, you and I,” I said, “if someone asserts that Simonides, or Bias, or Pittacus or any other wise and blessed man said it.”\n“I, for one,” he said, “am ready to be your partner in the battle.”\n“Do you know,” I said, “to whom, in my opinion, that saying belongs which asserts that it is just to help friends and harm enemies?”\n“To whom?” he said.\n“I suppose it belongs to Periander, or Perdiccas, or Xerxes, or Ismenias the Theban, or some other rich man who has a high opinion of what he can do.”\n“What you say is very true,” he said.\n\n\n\nSecond definition of justice\nJust to be transparent, I had a lot of trouble with this section. So I will most likely say a lot of wrong and stupid things.\nSocrates is then challenged by a man called Thrasymachus to give his own opinion about what justice is, instead of asking for the opinions of other men and thereafter blowing holes in their arguments. As always, Socrates is a slippery as an eel, and in the end it’s Thrasymachus and not he that gives us our second possible definition of justice.\nHis definition is:\nWhatever is to the advantage of the stronger is just\nQuiet the strange definition. He clarifies it by saying that, in so much as the ruler of a city is always the strongest, and that all laws set by such rulers are to their own advantage, it’s just for the citizens to follow these laws.\nThere are so many holes in this definition, I doubt Plato expects us to take it seriously. Socrates again uses a proof by analogy and assumes justice is an art(Why this again?!). He says that all art is practiced for the advantage of something else, never for the advantage of the artist. Medicine, to the advantage of the body. Cooking, to the advantage of meat. Art is always to the advantage of the weaker and the ruled, not the stronger and ruler. And so the the definition can’t be correct.\nI am not convinced, neither am I enlightened.\nAll that Socrates has shown is that there are two statements:\n\nJustice is an art\nJustice is the advantage of the stronger\n\nAnd that these two statements are contradictory. Come to think of it, that’s the same thing he did previously. He showed that the first definition and the statement that justice is art are contradictory. Is this some sort of proof by exhaustion? Is whole purpose of book 1 to show that justice isn’t art by trying all possible definitions? I don’t know.\nSocrates and Thrasymachus talk further about whether it’s better to be just or unjust, but Socrates’s arguments are somewhat simpler and less rigorous here. And he takes the existence of the soul for granted. I remember somewhat vaguely that Plato–or Socrates– gave a proof for its existence in the Phaedo dialogue, but I am not certain.\nWell, here is book 1 one finished, and what do I now know that I hadn’t before?\nThat justice is certainly not an art."
