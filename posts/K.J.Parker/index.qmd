## The beginning

My extra-marital affair with K.J Parker books (before that I was married to Stephen king's books, but then we had a short and violent divorce; I prefer not to talk about it) started innocently enough. I was browsing goodreads and, in a completely unremarkable manner ill-befitting the momentous occasion, came upon this book: [Colours in the Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/338404.Colours_in_the_Steel).

So I started reading the synopsis. And what was this? *fencer* lawyers? Lawyers who argue with swords instead of words? That was something new. By that time I had had my great rift with the fantasy genre; I was greatly disillusioned by it, feeling that it had become a great, swirling mass of cliches barely held together by uninteresting characters living in boring, simplistic worlds, with nary a hint of originality in sight. Now *here* was this book; it looked interesting, it seemed to have a unique premise, but surely only disappointment would ensue? Yet I tried it. I read it. And the rest, as they say, was history.

From now on, I am not going to talk about the fencer lawyers. Parker isn't the kind of fantasy writer to be chained and bound by a premise or idea. It was just a small plot point in this particular book. Instead I will talk about his books as a whole, and what differentiates them from run of the mill fantasy works.


## The Characters

We all know how characters in this genre are like. They are always... how do I say it? Too clean perhaps? Yes, too clean. I don't mean cleanliness as in moral cleanliness-- I speak about the fantasy genre as a whole, even the grimdark sub-genre of it. Rather, I mean *spiritual* cleanliness. There are no dark spots in their spirits, no *ambiguity*. Even when ambiguity exists, it often feels artificial, contrived, and so in your face that it stops being ambiguous and just becomes another trait in the character's personality-- an affectation.

Consider the following list of archetypes:

1. The Dark Lord.

2. The Evil Sorcerer.

3. The Hero.

4. The Barbarian.

5. The Rogue with the heart of gold.

The first archetype, the Dark Lord, I have never seen written well, except perhaps in Malazan Book of the Fallen, though the word is never explicitly used (there are certainly dark lords in Malazan, if we consider dark lords to be beings of considerable strength considered unanimously by the world to be a great threat). Of the Evil Sorcerer and The Barbarian, I cannot fail to consider Joe Abercrombie, who wrote these two archetypes with a great deal of complexity. But it's not complexity that I wish to find but ambiguity. I think most of us when considering the Evil Sorcerer of Abercrombie's (I will not name names, In case you haven't read the books) would, without hesitation, say what he would or wouldn't do. The same goes for the Barbarian.

Of the Hero I needn't speak. Of the Rogue, we have Locke Lamora, the gentleman bastard, but again, I don't think there is any doubt about what he would or wouldn't do in a given situation.

K.J Parker's characters aren't like that. You never quite know what what they are going to do. Sometimes they are hypercompetent, and at other times they seem incapable of doing anything right. They are both frightening and frightened. In Parker's world every human being is capable of doing *anything* under the right circumstances; there are no limits or red lines. And they are never archetypes.

The protagonists of a Parker book are rarely, if ever, inherently evil. What they seek is usually quite mundane: love, money, peace of mind, or merely not to die, but what they receive is rarely what they seek. They commit atrocities for the sake of their goals, or merely in a moment of anger, and they often feel bad about what they did afterwards. But they get right back to work soon after, for they share two qualities that is much in abundance inside all of us:

* The potential to commit *any* kind of act

* The ability to rationalize and justify their every action.

When meeting a Parker protagonist, I say, watch your back, and make sure that you don't blink.

## The Plot

Parker's plots usually start as dark comedy, then, bit by bit, they transform into dark, obscene tragedy. He reminds one of the old Greek tragedians and comedians of old, Euripides, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes and Eupolis (which is no surprise, Parker's historical fiction which he writes under his true name, Tom Holt, is every bit as good as his fantasy, and he even wrote a fantastic duology about Eupolis). Family is nearly always an essential part of the plot. And how could they not be, these people to whom we are bound by an unbreakable string not of our own making? Siblings, parents, children and lovers abound, with all the drama that such abundance entails.

But the drama is cold, sick. Worms and maggots fester. Read the books if you would like, but don't come blaming me once things take an unanticipated turn.

See the following quotation from Colours in the Steel, the first book in the fencer trilogy:


>‘I wanted to cut off his hand,’ she said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. ‘I was going to cut his hand off and then walk away, leaving him standing there, in front of everybody.’ She turned away, her hair falling across her face. ‘Getting killed isn’t a punishment for him, it’s part of his job. I wanted him to hurt.’

You will never guess the relationship between the speaker and the subject matter.

## The World

At first, I believed that every Parker's book was set in a different world. But then I read a few more, and started to hear names being repeated; names of people, of countries, of religions, and realized this: *that every book is set in the same world*.

Why was that such a surprise? Perhaps I was used to fantasy authors succumbing to the irresistible urge to lay their world bare. By succumbing to that urge, they make their world feel small, minuscule, for no amount of maps and detailed geographical description can make one writer's imagination equal to that of the world. In contrast, Parker is far more subtle; scattering a smattering of hints throughout all his works, he induces in the reader a feeling of grandness unrivaled in any other fictional world, except perhaps that of Erikson's.

There is magic and supernatural creatures in this world, but they are rarely mentioned in his main novels. If you would like to read K.J Parker with a more supernatural bent, read his collections of short stories. They are filled to the prim with witches, gods, sorcerer and devils.
