Every now and again I find myself in the mood to write a short story, which I then write, and which I then try to get published, but which never gets published.

Here is one:

# Midnight Ramblings

We were at our usual meeting place, my friend and I, the small and desolate coffee shop located three blocks away from the unlicensed chemist, at the end of the blind alley where the clown was killed most gruesomely the week before. We had been talking about the murder, but the talk had petered out soon after starting, seeing as neither of us possessed particularly strong feelings concerning the clown. In the silence, my friend watched his coffee cup which lay untouched in front of him, and I watched the shop’s owner, Sally, as she kept unceasingly dusting the clean and sparkling pinewood floor of the shop. Sally herself, almost surely, was watching us in our little corner booth, but with her ears instead of her eyes.

“My wife killed Tabby,” my friend suddenly said, breaking the silence. 

I laughed loudly. It seemed the funniest thing in the world to me, my friend’s wife killing Tabby. But perhaps it wasn’t so funny, I wouldn’t know. It was approaching midnight, and in this horrible last hour of the day, with my mental and physical state being by all metrics below standard, it was the toss of a coin whether I would deem something tragic or comical.

My friend stared disappointedly at me as I laughed but didn’t interrupt. He was very polite, was my friend. His parents had raised him extremely well.

“Sorry, sorry, something was stuck down my throat,” I said. I paused for a few seconds, then I couldn’t contain myself. “How did she kill Tabby, and would you by any chance have a picture?”

“No, I don’t have a picture. Of course I don’t have a picture. Can you imagine my state of mind at the time?”

“Yes, yes,” said I, and muttered some platitudes. I then remembered to give my condolences, though it was perhaps a little late.

“Thank you for your thoughts,” he said. "But I want your advice, and Sally’s as well.”

Instantly, making no attempt to hide her eavesdropping, Sally stopped cleaning, left the broom near the counter, and started approaching us. And why not approach us? There were no customers other than my friend and I in the shop; there were never any customers other than my friend and I in the shop. I just hoped to God she wouldn’t sit next to me.

She stopped near the table, let her eyes roam wildly all over the place. Then her lips pulled apart, showing yellow, dirty teeth, in an absolutely horrendous attempt at smiling.

“I heard my name,” she said. She took a seat next to me, so that I was besieged on both sides, with the wall to my right, where a cockroach had been crawling like a snail for the past hour, trying to reach the open window, and Sally to my left. I started wriggling to the right, in order to put a vast distance between us. There wafted from her a disgusting, stomach-churning smell, as per usual.

As I silently, and hopefully stealthily, made my way towards the cockroach, my friend explained the matter succinctly to Sally.

“Disgusting, absolutely disgusting,” she said. You were disgusting, I wanted to say, but held my tongue.

“I agree. You should have seen how proud she was afterwards, laughing and joking and saying all manner of derogatory things concerning Tabby” 

I stopped wiggling, seeing perhaps a chance to satiate my curiosity. “How about you describe the murder? More data is always helpful in these matters.”

“Ignore him. I know how hard this must be for you,” Sally told my friend, and patted my shoulder affectionately, to show she meant nothing offensive, as if we… As if we were lovers. Did she want us to be lovers? Was there a chance that I could love her back? I decided that no, I couldn't possibly reciprocate her affections, not after where her hands had been inside the week before. I was nearly cheek to cheek with the cockroach by now, its antennas waving hither and thither, its small legs moving in a flurry, to no avail; a lot of force, but no work at all. I wondered if it was perhaps diseased.

“What am I to do with her?” my friend asked.

“Kill her,” Sally said. “Creep behind her while she is in the kitchen, grab a knife, and then…” She pantomimed stabbing a person from behind.

“No class, no class at all,” I muttered.

Sally hissed, wounded at my justified criticism. “Then do you have a better idea?” she asked.

“There is an abandoned park,” I said. “Near the baker’s store–that blind baker who sells the worm-filled cookies. Inside the park, there usually sleeps a rabid dog. But nobody knows he is rabid, due to his unusual resistance to wakefulness.” I paused at this point of the proceedings, sensing a strange affinity with the dog. *An unusual resistance to wakefulness*. It seemed a shame to bring trouble to such an enlightened creature.

“Yes, what should I do with the dog?” my friend asked.

“A little thought and it’s obvious.” I felt something hairy and rough caress my right cheek.

My friend hummed, and I imagined the deep thoughts swirling inside his head. Sally started tabbing her fingers on the table while gazing at me suggestively. I thought about the clown, that demented, depressed clown, who couldn’t make me laugh no matter what he said or did.

Soon after, my friend and I left. He–I presume– went to his house and wife, and I to my little apartment. I passed by the park where the dog slept, beneath the light of the full moon. Poor thing, I thought, the only true victim should things proceed. I would admonish my friend severely, I decided, once he takes my advice.
