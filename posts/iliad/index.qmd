# Introduction

The first time I read the Iliad it left me feeling cold. I cannot now remember which translation I had tried first, but it was surely a mediocre one. Perhaps it was the one by Robert Fagles. Okay, I apologize, I truly apologize for that jibe; it was unfair of me, especially with how much I have had with his translation of The Count Of Monte Cristo. Nonethless.
